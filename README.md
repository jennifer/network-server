# Referred.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jennifer/referred-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jennifer/referred-client)

A fullstack JavaScript+React application that helps job-seekers track their professional network. Users add target companies, identify contact people, and track networking milestones, including:
* Initiating one-on-one contact
* Tracking responses
* Following up

And ultimately, getting referred!

## Demo

## Motivation

As a job-seeker, I wanted to build an app that fellow job-seekers and I could use to track my own professional networking. As an introvert, I wanted a project that would help me learn about networking, break it down into simple milestones, and get excited to meet new people.

## Requirements

* Be a fullstack app using HTML, CSS, React, Node, Express, and Mongoose
* Client and API should be deployed separately and stored in separate GitHub repos. 
* Client- and server-side code should be tested use TravisCI for continuous integration and deployment.
* App should be responsive, and should work just as well on mobile devices as it does on desktop devices.
* Code should be high quality, error free, commented as necessary, and clean.
* Styling on the client should be polished.
* Use vanilla CSS for styling capstones. Frameworks like Bootstrap are not permitted. 
* Have a comprehensive README file.
* Have a landing page that explains what the app does and how to get started, and the pages required to deliver functionality.
* Deploy a live, publicly-accessible version of the app.
